# Calculator
Attempt to develop a cross-platform calculator model utilizing a view interface and integrated commands.

Currently model is a go. Should have no problem adding new functonalities as elements. 
Elements are leaf components of the composite design structure.
Recently employed spring to inject the view. Autowired to my heart's content but I expect modify the setup 
since I want the commands decoupled from the view and ready to be called upon(recoupled?). My lack of experience
prevents me from expressing myself clearly. Ultimately, the commands are going to be used by whoever wants to 
use the model. But I either I forgot how to set that up or I never knew....
